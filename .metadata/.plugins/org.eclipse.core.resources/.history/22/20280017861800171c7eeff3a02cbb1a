/**
 * https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/window-string/
 * Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in linear time complexity.
Note that when the count of a character C in T is N, then the count of C in minimum window in S should be at least N.

Example :

S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"
Minimum window is "BANC"
